	Do you have that doubt that kind of creeps in from time to time? You know that one that you may or may not have bed bugs roaming around your house. There are a couple of signs that would certainly dictate that it’s more than likely that you have a bed bug problem. For example, if you keep waking up with itchiness and red spots all over you. If you can literally see the bugs, don’t wait to give us a call. You don’t have to see literal bed bugs or bed bug poop or anything like that to be able to give us a call or contact us. A lot of times it’s better to be safe than sorry. Getting some preventive services in can always be a good idea.
	
	Another thing that you don’t have to have decided upon when giving us a call is exactly the type of service that you need from us. If you are for example set on the idea that you want a heating bed bug removal service we’d be more than happy to provide one for you. Just know that sometimes we reserve that type of treatment for more extreme cases. There are preventive services and lighter cases that can be solved with bed bug spray solutions. We’d love to get a chance to talk and see how we could help you out. If you want to make sure that bed bugs are not something that you have to worry about, give us a call or contact us.
